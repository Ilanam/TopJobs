            Top Jobs Inc. is a company that renders recruitment services in India. 
            With a network of more than 30 offices nationwide, the company specializes in the
            areas of IT's, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, Information Technology,
            and Science.<br/><br/>
            
            It has tie-ups with the employers from
            various sectors.<br/><br/>
            
            The company provides services for full-time, part-time,
            and contractual employment.<br/><br/>
            
            Top Jobs also has a web-site that is updated with vacancy details. 
            A job seeker can also visit a Top Jobs office to enquire about vacancies and submit the resume.<br/><br/>
            
            Each Top Jobs office has a Client Relationship Manager, who liaisons with the employers to understand their requirements. 
            The office also has a Business Development Manager, who is responsible for gathering, sorting, and finally selecting job seekers.<br/><br/>
            
            The current system of Top Jobs has several limitations, the primary being its inability to adapt with the evolving technologies in the job marketing segment. 
            Many competitors of the company already have their job portals and are providing recruitment services online.<br/><br/> 
            
            As a result, many vacancies remain unplaced, and the number of job seekers seeking 
            Top Jobs services has declined, which subsequently has resulted in loss of revenue.<br/><br/>
